I use onshape for CAD modeling, the document is publicly available for free here https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6a819d25bf1a814981881c1b/w/ef2298128430f33acb4dde79/e/52fae9879cfd158b49a84c5f

The final part consist of a ring. Each led is then mounted onto a 'developable surface' a small individual part which can be printed as once piece and then can be folded to adjust the angle of each single LED. 

The CAD files can be exported in the onshape webapplication by anyone. 
A pre-exported file of each part is here :
